A specific sequence of transfers of administrative rights of an organization on GitHub can cause that organization to 404. As you can see, these "ghost orgas" can own repos, yet a click on the orga profile page will 404.

This also breaks some third party services. GitHub knows about this. They did for quite some time actually. But it's still unfixed.

Oh well...
